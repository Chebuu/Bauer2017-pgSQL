- Ensure all mat. views are subsetted by cohort.icustay_id
    - Speed improvements are likely possible in most queries
      if the query subsets by cohort.icustay_id early
- Ensure MIMIC-III categories match Bauer2017 categories
    - Example: Are the levels in ADMISSIONS.ADMISSION_TYPE the same as  
      the sub-sections under "Type of admission" from Table 1 in 
      Bauer2017? 
      - If not, any query extracting this information from the
        database will need to be refactored
      - Alternatively, the table can be recreated via R scripts, but 
        this should be avoided for organizational puposes
